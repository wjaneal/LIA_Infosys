<h2>Dear {Agent Name}:</h2>

 
<p>London International Academy (www.lia-edu.ca), established in 2002 in London, ON, has steadily grown to become a well regarded international secondary school. Now with 280 students representing six countries, we are seeking to further diversify our student body and become a notable player in international secondary education. We have consistently attracted extremely dedicated and talented students who, by their hard work and focus, and along with our well-qualified and dedicated staff create an excellent atmosphere for learning. Last year, for example, our students' team score on the Euclid mathematics contest was high enough to place them 11th in the world. As we grow, we are networking in the city of London and further afield to provide the best possible educational experience for our students.  We have developed relationships with local secondary schools, post secondary institutions and local government and non-profit organizations in order to immerse our students in the community, provide support for their learning and university applications and instill a sense of social responsibility in our graduates.

<p>I am writing to seek your advice and assistance with our expansion into the {Country Adjective} market. Specifically, we are looking to find academically advanced students and schools with strong reputations.  Might you kindly replay as to the availability of {agency name} to support us?
 
<p>Kind regards,
